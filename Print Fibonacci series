In Fibonacci series, the next number is the sum of previous two numbers. The series starts with 0 and 1, and then the next numbers are a sum of the previous 2 numbers.

For example 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55 etc.

Here the first 2 numbers are 0 and 1

The next numbers are:

1 (= 1 + 0)
2 (= 1 + 1)
3 (= 2 + 1)
5 (= 3 + 2)
And so onâ€¦

Write a program the first n numbers of the Fibonacci series.

Hint: You already know the first 2 values. How can you calculate the remaining?

Input Format
The first line contains T the number of test cases.

The following T lines contain n, the input for the Fibonacci Series.

Output Format
Print the values on a single line, separated by a space character. At the end of the line, print a new line.

Solutions :
t=int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n=int(input())
    first=0
    second=1
    print(first,second,end=" ")
    for i in range(2,n):
        Sum=first+second
        first=second
        second=Sum
        print(Sum,end=" ")
    print()
